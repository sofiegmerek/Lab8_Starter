# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I would choose 1.Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
for running my automated tests. I would have this be the testing for my recipe pipeline because the github actions allows the tests to automatically be run when anything is pushed, like a code change and tell me if it failed already so I can stop and go back and fix it.
2. No you would not use an end to end testing for checking if a function is returning the correct output, instead you would use a unit test.
3. I would not use a unit test to test the message feature of an application because unit tests are not well suited for testing how different components of an app work together. 
4. I would use unit testing to test the max length of a message as that is easy to unit test and doesn't depend on other moving parts in the application and has a clear goal.
